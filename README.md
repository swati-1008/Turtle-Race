# Turtle-Race

Python project to simulate a race game between 6 different coloured turtles.

The turtles are basically 
## Turtle graphics 
figurines, each instance of Turtle() representing 1 turtle contestant in the race.

The user gets to bid on any of the coloured turtle, and then the race starts.

Using 
## random 
forward pace distances, all 6 turtles move forward, and 1 of them finishes the game early.

The user now gets a message in the console, telling if he won/lose, and also the winner of the race.

The Turtle Screen is setup as a 500 x 400 dimension screen, and the turtle is considered to be of 40 x 40 size (default value).
